#Introduction
In this demo, we will cover how to use `shiny` and the differences between RStudio Connect and the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) service.

##What is `shinyapps.io`?
`shinyapps.io` is a service that aims to get your interactive web application published as soon as possible. It only offers support for applications and has limited authentication features. 

#What is RStudio Connect?
RStudio Connect is a service provided by RStudio. It is focused on publishing multiple file types, including Shiny applications and R Markdown reports enhanced with Shiny.

#What are the differences between the two?
`shinyapps.io` | RStudio Connect
-------------- | --------------
Support for Shiny apps only | Support for Shiny apps, RMarkdowns, and more
Focused on simple development | Provides a robust framework for publishing
Used by smaller applications | Used by academic institutions and companies
Free tier exists | Basic service costs $15,000

#`shiny`
`shiny` is a package used to build web applications in R. 

##Accessing data in `shiny`
`shiny` stores all objects in a vector called `input`. For example, if one creates an input object with the object id `button2`, then that object's value can be accessed by calling `input$button2`.

##Types of inputs available in Shiny
In the `shiny` package, there are 14 total UI input components that one can use. These are:

* `actionButton()`
* `actionLink()`
* `checkboxGroupInput()`
* `checkboxInput()`
* `dateInput()`
* `dateRangeInput()`
* `fileInput()`
* `numericInput()`
* `passwordInput()`
* `radioInput()`
* `selectInput()`
* `sliderInput()`
* `submitButton()`
* `textInput()`

`shiny` also has some output components. These are:

* `dataTableOutput()`
* `plotOutput()`
* `verbatimTextOutput()`
* `tableOutput()`
* `textOutput()`
* `uiOutput()`
* `htmlOutput()`

For example, here we can see the implementation of a application that displays the selected date. Selecting a date updates the text to display what was selected.

***

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dateInput("calendar", label = "Choose date to display")
renderText({paste("Selected Date: ", as.character(input$calendar), sep = "")})
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dateInput("calendar", label = "Choose date to display")
renderText({paste("Selected Date: ", as.character(input$calendar), sep = "")})
```

##Building a Shiny app
We will build an app that can take a .txt file, be provided the word delimiters, and then display the average length of the words. We will also add a graph that shows the frequency of word lengths. First, we need to create a new Shiny app and we can do this by clicking on File -> New File -> Shiny Web App.

Let's get all the code and then explain it. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
1  ui <- fluidPage(
2   titlePanel("Simple .txt file data"),
3   mainPanel(
4     textInput("delimiter", placeholder = "Input word delimiter"),
5     fileInput("fileInput", "Choose .txt file to analyze", accept = c("text/plain")),
6     actionButton("fileChosen", "Analyze!"),
7     textOutput("avgLen"),
8     plotOutput("wordLCount")
9   )
10 )
11
12 server <- function(input, output) {
13   data <- reactive({
14     textFile <- scan(as.character(input$fileInput$datapath),
15                      what = "",
16                      sep = input$delimiter)
17     
18     return(textFile)
19   })
20   
21   observeEvent(input$fileChosen, {
22     output$avgLen <- renderText({
23       paste("Average length of words in file:", sum(nchar(data(), "chars"))/length(data()))})
24     
25     output$wordLCount <- renderPlot({
26       vals <- as.data.frame(table(nchar(data(), "chars")))
27       ggplot(vals, aes(Var1, Freq)) +
28         labs(y = "Number of Occurrences", x = "Length of Word") +
29         geom_bar(stat = "identity")
30     })
31   })
32 }
33
34 shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

* Line `1` creates the UI, which is what the user will see. 
* Line `2` is the title of the app.
* Line `3` creates the main panel of the app.
* Line `4` creates a `textInput` object with the `outputId` being `"delimiter"`. The help text in this object asks the user to enter the delimiter for the file being analyzed.
* Line `5` creates a `fileInput` object with an `outputId` of `"fileInput"`. The title of this `fileInput` is `"Choose .txt file"`. Lastly, this `fileInput` will accept only `.txt` files. It is worth noting that the restriction of file types will only work once the app is published.
* Line `6` creates an `actionButton`. The `outputId` is `"fileChosen"` and the text on this button is `"Analyze!"`. This is the trigger that will be used to build the analysis.
* Line `7` creates a placeholder for text pulled from the `output$avgLen` object.
* Line `8` creates a placeholder for a plot taken from the `output$wordLCount` object.
* Line `12` starts the server function for any computation that the user doesn't need to see. This is where the reactivity of the Shiny app happens.
* Line `13` creates a reactive object called `data`. In the rest of the app, this object can be referred to by calling `data()`. 
* Line `14` creates an object called `textFile` and uses the `scan` method. `input$fileInput$datapath` refers to the `fileInput` object created in the UI. Once the user picks a file and clicks on the `fileChosen actionButton`, this object will be created. 
* Line `16` uses the 1 byte size character (default is whitespace) provided by the `delimiter textInput` object as the delimiter for the `scan` method.
* Line `18` returns the `textFile` object and sets it to be `data()`. * Line `21` runs the `observeEvent` method and uses the `fileChosen actionButton` as the trigger. `observeEvent` is a method that doesn't run its code until it is triggered.
* Line `22` creates a `renderText` object named `avgLen`. This is the object that line `7` pulls from.
* Line `23` sets the text for `avgLen`.
* Line `25` creates a `renderPlot` object named `wordLCount` referred to by the `plotOutput` in line `8`.
* Line `26` creates a data frame named `vals`. The data stored in this data frame is the number of occurrences of a specific length of word.
* Lines `27` to `29` plot the data frame using the `ggplot2` library.
* Line `34` runs the app.

Below, you can see the implementation of this app.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinyApp(
  ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Simple .txt file data"),
    mainPanel(
      textInput("delimiter", "Input word delimiter"),
      fileInput("fileInput", "Choose .txt file", accept = c("text/plain")),
      actionButton("fileChosen", "Analyze!"),
      textOutput("avgLen"),
      plotOutput("wordLCount")
    )
  ),
  
  server <- function(input, output) {
    data <- reactive({
      textFile <- scan(as.character(input$fileInput$datapath),
                       what = "",
                       sep = input$delimiter)
      
      return(textFile)
    })
    
    observeEvent(input$fileChosen, {
      output$avgLen <- renderText({
        paste("Average length of words in file:", sum(nchar(data(), "chars"))/length(data()))})
      
      output$wordLCount <- renderPlot({
        vals <- as.data.frame(table(nchar(data(), "chars")))
        ggplot(vals, aes(Var1, Freq)) +
          labs(y = "Number of Occurrences", x = "Length of Word") +
          geom_bar(stat = "identity")
      })
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 675)
)
```

##Publishing the app on `shinyapps.io`
To publish our newly created app, we first need to create an account. You can do this by visiting [this link](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/signup) to sign up. 

Now, we need to add our `shinyapps.io` account to our R session. To do this, follow the steps below.

***

Make sure `rsconnect` is installed and the library is added to your session. These commands should be run in the console.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('rsconnect')
library(rsconnect)
```

Now we connect our account to our current R session. Place the relevant information in each field marked by "". Alternatively, you can copy the text from your `shinyapps.io` account dashboard. This command should be run in the console.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name="username",
                          token="public token",
                          secret="secret token")
```

After doing this, run the following command to publish the currently open app to `shinyapps.io`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
deployApp()
```
